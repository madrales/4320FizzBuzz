# FizzBuzz
## INFOTC 4320: Software Engineering I
### Mason Adrales mta49n

This program is designed to print every number from 1-100. When the program encounters a multiple of 3, it will print Fizz. When it encounters a multiple of 5, it will print Buzz. When there is a multiple of both 3 and 5 it will print FizzBuzz. I have made multiple branches for this project; one for each feature of the progam.
